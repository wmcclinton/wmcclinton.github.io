        It's been a debate throughout the ages from Socrates to Plato to Aristotle; from Moses to Jesus to Mohammed; from Confucist to Siddartha to Lao Tzu; to you, your friends, and all those who will ever live: What does it take to live a good life?
        <br><br>
        In order to answer this we need to know:
        <br><br>
        1. What is a good life?
        <br>
        2. How does one live to make it more likely to achieve this good life?
        <br>
        3. What’s the big deal about trying to live a good life anyways?
        <br><br>
        <br><br>
        <h4>What is a good life?</h4>
        <br><br>
        I’m going to take a controversial point of view and say a good life is one that optimizes the total amount of happiness felt throughout your life. For example, on those days you feel sad we will give some negative score between -1 and -10 depending on how deep your sadness is, and on those days you feel happy we will give some positive score between 1 and 10 depending on how ecstatic your happiness is. Thus, the good life would be maximizing the sum total of these scores over all your days. 
        <br><br>
        So it's not worth it to trade a week of -7’s (in a week that would’ve only been a week of -1’s) to increase next week from a week of 7’s to a week of 10’s, but it would be worth it for turning a month of 7’s to a month of 10’s. So suffering now is only worth it for a guaranteed increase in happiness in the future greater than the amount of suffering. As well as vice versa, happiness now is always worth it if it's guaranteed that it doesn't increase sadness in the future greater than the amount of ecstasy gained now.
        <br><br>
        <br><br>
        <h4>How does one live to make it more likely to achieve this good life?</h4>
        <br><br>
        So many people will go through life minimizing the amount of current suffering due to the uncertainty of the future, leading to an unimpressive life of a bunch of -1, 0, and 1’s.
        <br><br>
        Many others go through life maximizing the amount of current happiness due to the uncertainty of the future, leading to a life that looks like hell with a bunch of 10’s followed by bouts of unexpected extreme sadness -10’s.
        <br><br>
        Some even go through life always sacrificing for the future in expectation that they can reap what they sow later, leading to a life that looks like actual hell with most of the days falling below -7’s and then a  handful of times when they’ve realized their overworked and decide to take a break they get 5’s that were supposed to be 10’s, because they feel like they should be working more.
        <br><br>
        No matter what strategy you choose there are a handful of virtues that turn out to be mostly helpful: knowledge/wisdom, kindess, and courage. Knowledge and wisdom in that, knowing how the future will unfold (whether you will die tomorrow, whether this thing will actually bring you happiness in the future, or even what opportunities you have) will help you plan your actions accordingly (just remember to account for the costs of attaining that knowledge). Kindness in that, helping your fellow human-beings reach their good life will probably lead to more benefits than costs. It sucks having a bunch of people around you that are not helping you live the good life, don't be one of them and I’m sure others will do the same (just remember to not do this at the expense of yours, but I doubt it would be, positively impacting others usually makes people happier anyways). And courage in that, at the end of the day you have to make a choice to act with the knowledge you have. Don’t be paralized in the fear of making a bad choice, chances are making the choice is better than not making one at all (just remember to not err on the side of foolishness, fear is known to heighten your awareness and attention to detail).
        <br><br>
        <br><br>
        <h4> What’s the big deal about trying to live a good life anyways?</h4>
        <br><br>
        It’s no big deal, many will go through life thinking they’ve lived a good life but didn’t even scratch the surface of what they could’ve possibly enjoyed, others would have lived a life so perfect and so ideal that many would be honored to live like that yet die wishing they could’ve done better. There will also be those who lived a horrible life and know it, and those who live a good life and understand they did their best. In your reality there is no objective good life for you, your current 5 might be a -10 to a hypothetical other version of you who decided to dropout and join that band back in youth, or 10 to the other hypothetical other version of you who decided to dropout and join that band back in youth and failed. To you there only exists how you think your life compares against these other hypothetical good lifes and not how they actually compare against them. So I guess the solution is to know this is your happy-go-lucky good life and you couldn’t have possibly done anything else. I guess trying your best in a way helps you think this couldn't have happened any other way, or at least thinking your trying your best. Damn this is depressing.
