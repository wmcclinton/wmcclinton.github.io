        This is an homage to those in which I find beautiful. Somedays I wish I could be:
        <br><br><br>
        a philosopher deep in thought about what this all is
        <br><br>
        a dancer flowing at one with the music getting lost in myself
        <br><br>
        a fighter ripping through an opponent unrestrained covered in sweat and blood
        <br><br>
        a model making others double take and cars crash just walking down the street
        <br><br>
        a poet provoking the deepest of human emotion at the drop of a pen, word by word
        <br><br>
        a scientist getting a glimpse of the world unbeknownst to any other human on earth
        <br><br>
        an artist making pieces awe inspiring work where people drop to their knees in rapture
        <br><br>
        an athlete doing the infeasible and hitting that breathtaking performance on the grand stage
        <br><br>
        a chef orchestrating such a culinary masterpiece that those who eat it pause in orgasmic bliss
        <br><br>
        a musician hitting those notes that ripple through a persons soul screaming at the top of my lungs
        <br><br>
        a hacker coding the most elegant back door attack in history toppling regimes at the touch of a button
        <br><br>
        a photographer capturing the curves of a majestic landscape against the curves of an even more majestic girl
        <br><br>
        a engineer crafting his magnum opus so new, so elegant, so unreal that it feels like magic when others get a glimpse of it
        
        <br><br>
        If you are any of these, I appreciate you as well as those of you who are giving it your all to get there. One of the most beautiful things is the fighting spirit. Get there or die trying.
        <br><br>
