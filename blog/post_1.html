        The human body sends 11 million bits per second to the brain for processing, about 1.5 Mb. So 1.5 Mb/sec x 60 sec/min x 60 min/hr x 24 hr/day x 365 day/yr = 47300 Gb or 47.3 Tb which I can get a harddrive for around $2k on Amazon. So to store 5 years of life it would cost me $10k, which is nothing compared to the size of R&D grants in Robotics. It's like 1/10th of a total grad student, basically nothing.
        <br><br>
        With this 5 years of data WebMD says your child should be “running, hopping, throwing and kicking balls, climbing, and swinging with ease”, and the CDC says your child should be “speaking clearly” and drawing people with “at least 6 body parts”.  My hope is that with the same amount of data we can get a robot to go from being as intelligent as an embryo to “telling what’s real and what’s make-believe” and “using the toilet all by itself” by age 5. This would be done by saving the lifetimes of robots and using that data to develop cognitive architectures that resemble a 5 year old.

        But all data is not equal. I can have a robot who during the first few hours of its life get trapped in a corner or under a box and spend the next 5 years of its life never having experienced anything else, or have a robot with a learning disability that never really learned how to walk and now it can’t pass me the butter because it spent its whole entire life crawling.
        <br><br>
        So, in order to ensure that the data collected is similar to what a child would collect during its lifetime we would need to learn like a child does both continuously and incrementally. This could be done via building in what I call “drives” into the robot. Some of the ones that come to mind are: Homeostasis, Self-Preservation, and Curiosity. Some drives might even be emergent from each other like wanting to be Self-Preserving in order to explore more out of Curiosity. These can be implemented as objectives that a learning system is trying to optimize during data collection.
        <br><br>
        There are still a lot of unanswered questions like: what is the objective function for homeostasis or self-preservation, how actually does a learning system optimize these quantities, can we maximize these objectives stability and successfully, and will this even work?
        <br><br>
        In practice, we can use teleoperated demonstrations to bootstrap learning, build-in handcrafted features and actions to help with data collection, rapidly develop in simulation, and try out many things in parallel hoping one works, basically engineer the hell out of this. It’ll be all worth it when one day we come home and see our robot taking its first steps, or say “mama” for the first time.
        <br><br>
