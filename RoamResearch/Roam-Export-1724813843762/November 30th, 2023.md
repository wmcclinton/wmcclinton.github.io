- Formulate our entire planning objective and representations as a big NN and optimisation problem. Talk about how hard coding a representation is like freezing a part of the network. This defines a nice space to search over with finite predicates and actions, in a continuous state space
- Think about Leslieâ€™s continuous state space problem
