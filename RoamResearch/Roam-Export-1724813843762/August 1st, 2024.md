    - Finally understand Risk Models
        - Stat Arb vs the Economists
        - Does adding factors make predicting return streams easier or harder?
        - They are both right
        - Stat Arb thinks about the problem as the risks are lol IR and hard to predict thus lets only predict idio
        - Economists think RISKs are the only persistent, explainable, alpha or bets
        - Tomorrows Beta is tomorrows Alpha
        - French and Fama:
            - Factors as better predictions, so we can leverage the factors for more predictable return
        - Stat Arb:
            - Factors as Risk, so we can capitalize on idio/alpha because it's easier to predict and less volatile
        - Side Note:
            - Diversification in Time
            - Seisure as a market crash, phase lock all time scales ^
            - Selling your Book - Cooperative Strats/market manipulation vs. Competitive where sharing has market decay 
        - If you run PCA on data, bigger factors are easier to predict
        - As more people acknowledge the Risk Factors and leverage returns for it the volatility goes up and IR goes down, 
            - Or does it go up because we are all doing the same thing
        - Economist and Stat Arb are kinda doing the same thing looking for that next thing that explains alpha - I would say the difference is whether they share it 1. and 2. the typical time horizon they care about (maybe)
        - Mosaic
    - If you have a signal and make it orthogonal to Barra can it be better at predicting future returns or is it always worse 
    - Iâ€™m such a beginner, so much to learn (Ryan Alder definitely has 2+ years of experience and it shows)

    - The Brain at least the neocortex is a large table of correlations and decentralized memory that caches the statistical properties of the the world, and acts as a tool for our base desires / lizard brain which maintains our homeostasis and reproductive capabilities
        - this model of the world model internal sensations and phenomena too, as well as even meta properties about the system itself - where the ability to model oneself is conscience which is not a true or falsity but a scale
        - evolution is happening to everything homeostasis and stability is the fitness criteria and every since molecule to lizard brain to cortex is pursuit of that
