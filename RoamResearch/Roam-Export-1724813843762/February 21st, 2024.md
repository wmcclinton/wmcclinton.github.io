- OSAP - convert all signals to python make data pipeline to test all signals
    - and so you can use different data
- All signals define a portfolio and my returns of portfolio can be regressed against other portfolio to see how my returns are explained by their returns. if my portfolio is different it is called alpha, but now my alpha generating portfolio can be thought of as another risk factor:
    - can’t we just regress on the linear combination of all signals/portfolios/risk factors ???
        - than alpha would be 0
        - the question now becomes what risk factors are other people using “I.e. that matter” and what combination will I use that’s different
    - Think about in the context of weighted combination of Arrow Debreau Securities - all possible portfolios/payoffs
        - Maybe think about an asset as a noise arrow debreau security
- Pickle Formula:
    - Formula:
        - - 1. they put in ETH and get Pickles (inversely related to the amount of people Apeing in to it)
        - - 2. they stake their Pickles to get a share of those future profits and more pickles
        - - 3. Pickles last long so the profits are given out whenever someone "eats" them (pays gas and burns pickles - of an increasing amount - puts deflationary pressure) to distribute dividends to stakers (10% max 1 every epoch)
