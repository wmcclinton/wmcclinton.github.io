- Stock game:
    - separate deck into: A, J, Q, K (face cards)  and 2-10 (number cards)
    - shuffle number cards and flip cards until you see a black:
        - that is the starting price for the day
            - * $100
        - continue to flip cards over these are percentage up or down each hour for 8hrs (cards) after the starting price
    - after each flip of a card: play the Ace or Queen to buy at a price and Jack or King to sell respectively.
    - If you don’t sell by the end you get the closing price
    - you can play Ace and Queen at the same time to double down
    - play until someone gets to $200 or someone goes bankrupt (start with $100)
    - 2 players each player gets 2 sets of face cards if 3-4 each player gets 1 set if 5-8 each player gets 1 pair of face cards
- Multi regression to portfolio returns of risk factors
    - every signal defines a series of portfolios which has a price that defines returns
    - you can find the price of a portfolio by a weighting of arrow debreau securities
        - so a return is you have some weighting at t and then have some other weighting at t+1, the difference of the return
        - EMH means no arbitrage at each t
        - let’s take each stock as an arrow debreau security -> you shouldn’t have more factors than you have stocks???
