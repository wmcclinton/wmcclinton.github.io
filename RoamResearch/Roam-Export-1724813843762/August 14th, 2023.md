    - Context vs Content
    - You can’t do it alone - Trust is important
    - Leaders lead by example, your asking people to spend most of there time working for the companies, but you aren’t doing the same
    - Everything you need you already have it’s about taking the first step: a heart, a brain, courage
    - I resonate with the people at Aneta’s goal to take down the modern financial system, banks shouldn’t be investing our money we should. AI shouldn’t be owned or gate keeper by anyone, people should have the liberty to use it
    - Brainwash yourself: decentralization, liberty, ai, internet, bitcoin, writings of tim Berber’s lee, (Vint Cerf inspired you)
    - Think about what you are an expert in and fix pain points in that and using that
    - Worry less, say what you mean. Just do and ask for forgiveness
    - As AI tools get more and more powerful, the role of decentralized governance will become more and more important - I care about that
