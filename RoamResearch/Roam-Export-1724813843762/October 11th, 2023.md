- GFlowNets
    - Like the video. I think Bengio is going a bit kookoo at times but I like all the promises of this architecture and how it relates to Model Based RL
    - Identifying DAGs with GFlowNets sounds sick af. Would be definetly interesting to see if it scales to robotic data, not just simulation data
        - it seems like they only need like 100 datapoints to get a graph with 20 - 50 edges
        - I like how GFlowNets were built with high cost oracles in mine
    - We should def find some time to meet this week I’m on KL Malaysian time
- History of Finance Video:
    - We need to get more and more out of the less and less we have, and finance does it
    - Computers will upend finance where information and market coordination becomes unfathomable
    - Affliction and Trust is everything
    - Markets make the allocation of resources more efficient and provides proper incentives
    - Quantification precision and prediction
        - more and more efficiency gains
    - Designing better systems is the goal
- Email to schonfeld
    - Project Generative Order Limit Book Modeling
        - Why I can do it:
            - Very interesting
            - Have knowledge with GANs through some research in undergrad and familiarity with LSTMs through courses
            - State-Space Models are used in Model Based RL all the time so is HiPPO
        -  What can be improved:
            - Only 102 Days of training data and 12 Days of validation and test data
            - Only with Google (small-tick) and Intel stock (large-tick)
            - Only do 10 levels of Order Book Data (prediction for 10 best prices)
            - It Truncates extreme orders <0.1% of data
            - Extrapolating only 100 time steps out given 500 orders
            - Over predicts Execution orders (maybe because of error correction mechanism)
        - Questions:
            - Predictive Power vs Inference Time
            - Out-of-Distribution (time) Perplexity 
            - Training Time vs Performance
                - How often would we need to retrain

- After finishing What Color Is Your Parachute
    - A job like Quantitative Researcher at place like Nova Prospect would be nice
        - Or Quantbot on a Crypto related project
        - Or Citadel HQ on a new Crypto Division
    - But current career path is Quant for Crypto
    - And Start a Decentralized AI Company 
- So currently I’m lacking skills and funding to do it on my own. So I need to learn strategy development and full pipeline development for QR labs

- Goals:
    - MIT PhD (So they pay me well)
    - Quant Research Internship and Skills (To get dream job see above and start my own company)
