        - Ideas:
            - Design humanoid robot with overlapping embodiment with ALOHA robot - all trajectories translate directly to the humanoid
            - Create a large ALOHA dataset
                - Behaviour Skills
            - Solve Behaviour ^ then compound with skills. Perception is separate and partial observability is handled separately
            - Copy Figure Demo for a 10th of the price
            - Decentralised Storage
            - Decentralised AI
