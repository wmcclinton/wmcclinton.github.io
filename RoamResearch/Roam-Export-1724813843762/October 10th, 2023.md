                            - QR interviewing (2 years) - Project + Networking + Datathons
                                - Get the skills needed to be successful during an internship
                                - Also learn more about the career
                            - Taking Econometrics now

    - (2) Write essay on current life findings and goals as you approach 25
        - Life is tough. My goal has been to understand the brain and build an intelligent machine throughout the years. This still is my goal, but I’m realizing you need wealth, data, and economic systems to get there. Cracks at AGI have been hit by numerous companies like OpenAI, Google, and Meta, but I do think a need for these systems to be open access and distributed like the internet is important. I’ve decided to take a detour on the path for AGI through economics and distribution. I want to develop a fabric of AI open like the internet, globally maintained, trained, and held. Bitcoin did a great job of demonstrating how incentive systems can build trust and a decentralized network, I will take inspiration from this to build off of. At the same time while I develop this I need a career that is lucrative enough to provide funding for my ventures and support my family.
            - Thus my goal in order are: PhD (for clot), QR Trad->Crypto (as lucrative career), Fabric (as main project), BJJ/Sev (for health)
    - (4) X Do Flower Chart
    - (5) Do career planning and story MIT Sloan Slides
    - (6) X Reassess goals:
        - PhD, QR (full-time), DCI, and Fabric
        - PhD paper plan, QR study plan, DCI goals, and Fabric Jan Launch Plan 
    - (***7) Econometrics HW
    - (***8) X Send Schonfeld Projects (10000 equities, autoregressive limit-order-book, etc)
    - (9) Fabric White Paper
    - (10) Fabric MVP
    - (Later) 20 YouTube thumbnails
    - (Later) Figure out Finances (monthly income and debt pay off plan)
- It’s not about money it’s about skills to generate money: Financial IQ
