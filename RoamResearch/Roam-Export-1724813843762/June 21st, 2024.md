- Todo:
    - Add alpha search to Jupyter
    - Finish gts for truebeats
- [[Schonfeld]]
    - donâ€™t even need pyarrow
    - can just save pandas to kdb
    - Alpha Search -> Mining for Gold in GTS
        - I can take the define signals and run analysis over all of them at different horizons seeing heat map and alpha decay
