- [[Notes]]:
    - When I talk to Sev and complain about the 6+ things I'm doing and say I have no time. She says pick one or your fail at all of them, and my heart mind and soul all react "No" out of a deep feeling to prove everyone wrong. Forcing my hand to sacrifice more and more for bigger and bigger ambitions
    - I think I need a seperation of spaces, It's hard to work here. I thought it was easy but it's not.
    - On the bright side, even if you fail your interview you'll have 2 weeks in Europe to study and explore as much as you want. It's a marathon not a race.
