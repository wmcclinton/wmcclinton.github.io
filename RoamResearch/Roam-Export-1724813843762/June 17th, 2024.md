            - goal:
                - make trades to capitalize on alpha while minimizing trading costs
        - One data source that people might not be looking at when trading crypto is order book data (across exchanges) and network transactions (Coinbase vs not Coinbase). If you as one of the projects want to try combining all of that to a kdb database that’d be nice
