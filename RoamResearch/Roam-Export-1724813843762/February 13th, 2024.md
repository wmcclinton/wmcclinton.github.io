- I’m failing BD and DCI, is that ok?
- Make a market simulation to show how market mispricing gets fixed (mean reversion), show how momentum can form - use Shiller model

- Print Verfied ML with ZK paper
- Print Predicate Invention and Operator Learning Paper
- TLPK Meeting:
    - We have the predicate invention paper and new operator learning procedure, maybe together they can learn to use diffusion policies (assuming some connecting operators and predicates are given)
        - We’ll basically maximize the same objective with hill climbing in the loop as proposed before
        - This can be the first step on the way to the journal paper I wanted to do
        - Propose Predicates (can minimize predicate proposal by current predicates - along with modal logic), Hill Climb to Find Operators, Score, repeat
- [[Values]]
    - Buffet vs Thorp
        - The game of bridge
