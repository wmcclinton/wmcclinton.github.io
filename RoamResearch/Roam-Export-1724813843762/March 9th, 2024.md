- USD Stability (USDS):
    - Algorithmic Stable Coins have failed horribly
    - This is due to thinking about getting early members rich as opposed to maintaining stability of the peg above all else
        - you need a mechanism of incentives members to maintain the peg and be there for the long run, but that comes second to the stability of the coin
    - [They messed up ](https://www.business.rutgers.edu/business-insights/thought-leadership-what-happened-terra-luna-and-can-it-happen-again)
    - Similar design as Terra Luna but over collateralise like MakerDAO
        -  you can stake: USDT, USDC, or ETH
        - to get stability token
        - Similar trading mechanics to Uniswap with stables
    - Things to maintain stability:
        - overstaked - stake lock
        - supply/demand - max mint amount
        - incentives - token holders want to keep price
        - Reserves
    - As stakers get rewards if protocol remains same or grows, if the pool shrinks it is sign of instability and stakers will proportionally lose collateral
    - stability coins are burnable to get that collateral - at a certain burn rate - you only get half the arbitrage tho the rest goes to reserves
