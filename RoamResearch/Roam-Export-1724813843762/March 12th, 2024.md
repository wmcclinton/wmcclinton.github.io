- Whats the future of markets look like:
    - AI, Blockchain, Robotics
        - 1. Foundation Models Everywhere
        - 2. Crypto used by everyone
        - 3. Automation providing goods and services
    - Buy tokenised automation - given by a coin
        - fill a wallet for a process and that process turns that into a resource. Then pay that coin to get that resource in the future
    - It’s all about connecting points - how do AI connect with digital ecosystems - how do AIs connect with the world - how do digital ecosystems connect with the world
    - oracles are important. opposite of oracles are important too (ie actuators). turn on chain votes into real world actions.
    - AI specialty
    - Quant Job
    - Crypto and Hobby Robotics - hobby
        - upload data get tokens that you can use to pay for robot life and robot mines by living it’s life too by sharing data with the cloud. Learning happens with this closed data and robots mind gets updated, adding value to the network.

    - I have training in applied AI and Robotics, and have really enjoyed my finance/quant classes (interesting problems and mathematical rigor). I want to further explore quantitative research and see how the two can be integrated.
