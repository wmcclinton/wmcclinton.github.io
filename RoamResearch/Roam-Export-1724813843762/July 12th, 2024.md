        - during the first class he handed out a little sheet of paper and asked to write the number of what you think is 2/3's the average of the numbers the entire class would write down. This is a well know problem in behavior theory when "if" we were all rational we would write 0 because that's what we'd all converge too if a group of rational agents thought long and har about this, but that's a big if, you have those who don't understand the game, those lazy in their calculations, and even those vindictive people who will just right 100 for the fun of it. I being a student of behavior theory and game theory myself knew that studies show that "k=2" that people tend to ask the question "well what if the other person did that in response to thinking about my choice" on average around two times. For example, the average from 0-100 is 50 so 2/3 would be 33.3, well what if the everyone chose 33.3 in response to thinking about everyone else's choice, so I should write 2/3 of 33.3 which is 22.2, well what if the everyone chose 22.2 in response to thinking about everyone else's choice in this way as well, then I should write 2/3 of 22.2 which is 14.8, well what if .... On average after the second run of this people would stop so at 22.2 thus I wrote 14 thinking I was a genius.
        - The next week he announced the results and the answer was 13.7 and the winner wrote 12.8 - it was closest without going over. Frustrated I asked the guy how he got 12.8 and he said I 33.3 was to obvious so I kinda guessed. That's when I learned my first lesson, not that people are irrational but that even though people are irrational you still might lose acting rationally only, with a rational edge as well as many many times at bat as well can you come close
