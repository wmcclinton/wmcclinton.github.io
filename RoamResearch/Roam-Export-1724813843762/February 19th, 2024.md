- LIS Meeting 03/01:
    - Continual Operator Learning (Beam Search)
        - Setting is you assume that you have a working operator theory and you have to learn a new predicate/predicates that you know you can toggle (look at the data) for a new black box policy, then you take a step of our predicate invention and operator learning to learn it.
            - We assume a basis set of predicates, operators, skills, and samplers
            - We assume we have long horizon demos (of many different tasks as well as ones containing the skill we want to learn), a new skill we want to learn, and a goal classifier
            - Run predicate invention and operator learning, show we might need beam search
            - If predicate invention is not enough than add an LLM or Human in the loop
            - Novelty: incremental setting and beam search
