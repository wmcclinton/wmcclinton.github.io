- [[Life]]
    - learn from the German Wiermar:
        - Tell people what and why to do something not how
        - Be a Doer and a Thinker
        - Flexibility of the mind is a powerful thing
        - Mission Command Mentality
        - Humility at the sense of the game, not humility at the feet of your opponent
        - Holding two ideas at the same time and still taking action
        - Plans are useless but planning is indispensable
