        - Jeremy had great thoughts. Thought HBS people were not good for startups (biased), but agree. He imagines having a single application to recommend better connection and integration of devices. He sees the limitation of devices, and limitation of having a single layer solution, but sees the value proposition of having a place where users can put in their devices and get recommendations for optimization, or anything that tackles the user experiences of the device
    - [[TODO]]:
        - BD graphs + Demo
            - CV for InView
            - Move/Center after drag
            - Better Sampler
        - Drag Classifier and skill with Parma for order of pulling
        - TAMP Blog Post
        - Make WSQ study sheet/notes and study an hour
        - Find MBA 3rd Person (Class or YC)
        - (Today) Aneta Arb code
            - BTC -> cBTC [Done]
            - cBTC -> ADA (selinium python)
            - ADA -> BTC (JS Lucid + manual coinbase)
        - (Secondly) VirtueAI Lite Paper
    - https://a16z.com/marketplace-100/
    - Don’t forget that Financial Intelligence and Time and Freedom are very important
    - I want to be rich enough where Sevara doesn’t have to work and can just look pretty, and buy whatever she wants
    - Maybe you just want to be a quant
    - Need more time to do cBTC arb bot (Maybe tmrw)
    - This weekend (including friday) prepare for your interview
        - Start by going through all vides and making cheat sheet. (Recording everything would be nice too)
        - Finish WSQ project - answer old project questions
        - Study cheat sheet, do practice problems
    - Maybe perfect school year is pursue start-ups 20hrs, HBS course 10hrs, and study/read for quant rounds 10hrs, Research/BD 20hrs, Exercise and chill the rest of the time
    - Actually plot out earnings of different paths: Google vs Citadel vs Startup
    - Only way out of this shit show is through a startup, but FAANG or Quant can by sometime and security. So end goal is break capitalism, to do that I need to escape the rat race so startup/businesses, to do that I need time and security potentially work a few years like you did google
        - Worked at google, did Masters went broke, then did quant exited the rat race, then did PhD/startup
        - VirtueAI or Genesis will be breakout, and the break capitalism through robotics
    - Since Rohan got $350000 offer if I get that or more I’ll dropout
