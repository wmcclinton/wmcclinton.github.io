- It's not uncommon for individuals to pursue careers that are somewhat different from their PhD research topics. While your PhD is in robotics and AI, it doesn't mean you can't transition into a career in Quantitative Research. The skills you've gained during your PhD, such as data analysis, programming, problem-solving, and critical thinking, can be highly transferable to quantitative roles.
- You can bridge the gap by gaining additional knowledge in finance, economics, and quantitative methods. Consider taking relevant courses, attending workshops or seminars, and networking with professionals in the field. Highlight the analytical and technical skills you've acquired during your PhD in your job applications and interviews, as these skills are highly valued in Quantitative Research positions.
- Remember, many employers appreciate diverse backgrounds and perspectives, so your robotics and AI background can be an asset, bringing a unique perspective to the field of quantitative research. It's about showcasing how your skills and experiences can contribute to the role, even if they aren't directly related.
