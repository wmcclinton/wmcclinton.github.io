    - After not passing my Nova Prospect interview
    - I’m reflecting on my decisions
    - Helin Gao had a friend who went from Quant Finance to robotics, while I’m trying to go the other way
    - Will robotics blow-up, is quant finance more impactful
    - What should I do with life

    - WSQ notebook questions 1-2:30pm
    - WSQ cheat sheet - briefly look over
    - Review Project and potential changes 2:30-3:00pm
        - WSQ Final Call:
            - Feedback on Project
                - No need to normalize 
                - returns = (diff return) / returns
                - Remove normalized returns
                - sqrt(252) not just len(returns)
                - might want to fill
                - don't need to resample by the day
                - purfication as when you calculate sharpes to 252
                - cheating look ahead bias
                - Part 2:
                    - fixed return computation should be a percentage
                    - shift signal by 1, you have a look ahead bias
                    - still have len in sharpes
                    - strev should be (/ not -) for combined high and combined low
                    - turn convex optimization to a loop with continous rebalancing everyday
                - Phrasing Quant Internship is important
                - Quick Feedback:
                    - SAT Math Credential - 800
                    - Frontload import languages
