- Im going to join a market-neural team who does exactly what we communicated in class
    - get a big risk factor model from a vendor
    - then define signals/starts and find alpha
    - but if every signal defines a portfolio than I don’t understand the difference between alpha and beta, for example I define an UMD signal (Momemntum) and find with some parameters it generates alpha what prevents me from making/calling that risk factor
        - I think it’s just a conceptual problem I have
    - Is it risk factors are what we are trying to control for and alpha is what we can provide
    - are than the huge collection of risk factors that we get just a list of know alphas the market will most likely exploit
- What is ur personal take of UMD
