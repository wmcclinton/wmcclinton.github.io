    - Hey Willie, I think you can try to go with the first project. It is a topic of interest these days -- applying ML to order book data, so will look good on next year apps. You don't have to finish the entire project, but just getting some part of it done during the summer and having it on your resume is okay. Even if you just set up the data and construct some features, that could be enough. If you do go down that route, I would recommend trying to do it on at least a few hundred stocks though. Also, I would try to find a few other papers. General idea is deep learning + order book data to predict future returns.  You've already done some factor stuff for your project so it should be good to diversify. Then when comes interviews you can speak to both topics, and they're fairly complementary.
