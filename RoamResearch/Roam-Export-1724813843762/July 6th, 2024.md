    - You need to prove to yourself that you can make money, that you are worth the half million dollar offer:
        - This takes finding new alpha
        - Implementing it
        - And executing/following thru well
        - Note: you can do it in these internship, or you can do it at home with crypto, equities, etc
    - Schonfeld and I have a symbiotic relationship, I get to play around with cool ideas that Ryan and I dream up, and see if we can make money with them. I learn about all the important stuff the team does and they get to learn from my exploration and tinkering. My goal beyond them is to make GTS a money making machine (new outfitted alpha/gts), additional alt data handling - simple to test and mess around with new signals and get visualization
