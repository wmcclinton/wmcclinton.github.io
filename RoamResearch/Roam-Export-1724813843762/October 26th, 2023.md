- WSQ Final Call:
    - Feedback on Project
        - No need to normalize 
        - returns = (diff return) / returns
        - Remove normalized returns
        - sqrt(252) not just len(returns)
        - might want to fill
        - don't need to resample by the day
        - purfication as when you calculate sharpes to 252
        - cheating look ahead bias
        - Part 2:
            - fixed return computation should be a percentage
            - shift signal by 1, you have a look ahead bias
            - still have len in sharpes
            - strev should be (/ not -) for combined high and combined low
            - turn convex optimization to a loop with continous rebalancing everyday
        - Phrasing Quant Internship is important
        - Quick Feedback:
            - SAT Math Credential - 800

            - All Revelant Coursework really doesn't matter
        - Things for Schonfeld:
            - Try to Network talk to everyone (see other teams and what they do)
            - 10 weeks is short - learn as much as you possibly can (don't focus on interview prep)
