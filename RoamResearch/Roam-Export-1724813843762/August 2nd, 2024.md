- Concept:
    - Prediction Market
        - Give people credits 
        - They can trade on the market
        - based on performance they get more credits (you can have them paper trade)
        - Then if you are in the top performer on the trading game you get rewards money
        - In the backend we can either  (1.) sell data, (2.) we take the risk and trade with the top to performers

    - Model
        - Residuals
            - difference between return of an asset and it factored returns (i.e. itâ€™s idio returns)
        - Arb Signal Function
            - residuals -> summary stats / signal
        - Arb Allocation Function (could be non parametric)
            - summary stats / signal -> portfolio weights
    - Objective
        - Optimize Sharpe
