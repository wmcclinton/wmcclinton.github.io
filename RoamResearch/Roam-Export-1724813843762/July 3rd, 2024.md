        - The Data
            - Visualize the returns you want to predict, alongside the data you have - transform the data into different scalars for each concept so it’s visualized well - either raw or detrended is fine
        - The Holes
            - Try to see what parts of the signal are correlated and what parts are not for each different data
            - How can they be systematically combined to match the data
                - it’s like a puzzle where every data can be: x, +, floored, ceiling, temporally shifted backwards
        - The Explanation
            - Now that you have a match why does it make sense, you are capitalizing on a market misallocation. Which one of these explains it:
                - behavioral factor
                - paid for risk
                - information advantage
                - liquidity providing
        - The Testing
            - Now run your stats and visualizations to see if your signal is robust
            - Finally when all parameters are fixed and chosen run backtest
        - Important Note:
            - What’s important in all of these is simplicity, reframe from complex data/ signals, complex compositions of them, weird esoteric explanations, and crazy testing strategies / parameter finding
