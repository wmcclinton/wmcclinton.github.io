    - Casual Causality - Alex’s 
        - “ Have a chalkboard at my apartment and drinks. Just give me an attainable time and date and we can do this.” 
            - Teach us Causality
        - “ Causal effects only make sense for variables you can intervene on. But the space of variables that can be conceivably intervened on is small compared to all of reality. So, in causal discovery work (or robotics etc.) how to you tell the difference.” Brain Teaser

    - Discursivity of non-Philosophical Thought
        - “The technical term I believe is discursive, yes. Unlike philosophy more generally (though there are some that think philosophy is discursive, which seems absurd to me, but I digress).”
        - “So we need a way of measuring truthiness for statements neither empirical nor tautological”
        - “Lol. Good luck with that. This is measure without a metric.”
        - What’s good:
            - The point can be made further by two Greek words: gnosis and philosophy. That is knowledge (gnosis) and philosophy (love of wisdom). If one knows the truth, the only thing left is to implement, not to research. So, the first act of the Scientist in my view is not to go and seek something out towards operational change, but rather to observer. Here we see a similarity with the fine arts.
            - This really should be a 4h discussion over some sort of drink, because the topic is too deep for typing. lol

    - The Science Problem
        - “ So all the science and math is for what? A path in this unknowable venture”
        - “ It's why religious liberty is such a stress by people like Locke. It's not a devaluing of these questions, but a demarcation of their importance.”
        - “ Philosophy of love is a criminally under explored area by serious thinkers.”
        - Here's a moral thought experiment: would you rather have your father be tortured or be the torturer?
        - Antagonistic social theories have done a lot of damage, I suspect. Not only are they corrosive, but they're technically not right.
