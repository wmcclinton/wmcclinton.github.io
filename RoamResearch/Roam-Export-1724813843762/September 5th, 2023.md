    - The intuitive sense of an assets value like when estimating the value of the place of Versailles can be broken into qualitative and quantitative measurements
        - for example we can use the income flow of the palace as a qualitative measurement or even the predicted income flow, but all of those will pave in comparison to its actual value
            - in these cases we should use qualitative measures like how much a person would buy it for or how many people would die for it, or the feeling of awe you get when seeing it
            - We can boil this intuition to a measuring how uncertain you are about the future income, and not measure able aleatoric uncertainty but epistemically uncertainty
            -  A model which uses a guess of epistemically uncertainty to trade off between quantitative and qualitative of measurements
