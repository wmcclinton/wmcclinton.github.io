- [[Notes]]:
    - What are you passionate about? AI decision making with data, automation, crypto and decentralization, and markets
    - How to make money as a roboticist
    - Maybe sell robocoin
    - Maybe focus on working and starting a robotics startup instead of quant
    - I realized that I can work my way up the business/robotics later - only roboticist interested in crypto dev - and opening so solving simple problems
        - like Sev said
        - Genesis might be a good startup start or AI Coin
        - Leslie’s Marketplace of models
    - If I get a quant internship then I’ll try if not I’ll intern at robotics places:
        - Tesla AI
        - Amazon Robotics
        - Nvidia
        - Figure
        - etc
    - AIcoin/ibit can be used to query Detic and Sam models
        - Detic and Sam are open source just need people to run them
    - Genesis is device marketplace and VirtueAI is model marketplace
    - I can let the researchers do research, the devs do development, and the engineers engineer solutions. I will just make the glue/marketplaces (keep it simple)
        - Real AI/Robotics/IoT is probably 10-20 years out but getting ahead of the curve will be great
            - competing with likes of google and amazon though might not be good, but any share of this growing market would be great
            - Helps decentralize AI research
            - May just give others ability to run lots of AI models
            - Offering an alternative is good, doesn’t have to be the only way or cheapest
    - What’s the simplest way to do ^^^ MVP model marketplace - run a model get multiple queries of network compare and send payment
    - it’s an infinite game, make the world better, explore with friends
    - Save, get quant, go to south east Asia, make more companies
    - Make point 72 study plan:
        - Sat/Sun
        - Project, Videos, etc?

    - Challenges of AI:
        - Learning representations and predictive models
        - Learning to reason
        - Learning to plan complex actions to achieve objectives
    - You would just do research all day if you could, but you need to feed yourself and buy a house etc.
    - SGD can be seen as a type of search (with poorly understood heuristics) over the potential programs a Neural Network can take and the deeper the more able the program to closely approximate the program you want which is the Kolmogorov compressor of the data (because compression is equal to prediction). This connects the theoretical understanding of supervised learning and connects it to a theoretical objective for unsupervised learning.
