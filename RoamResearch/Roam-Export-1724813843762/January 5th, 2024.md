- Goals
    - I want be an intelligent investor, have money and spend my days building things: brains, house, ecosystems
    - To do that I need:
        - 1. Capital: Cash, Assets etc.
            - IQ -> Get Capital
        - 2. Know-How: To manage it, make more from it, not lose it all, etc.
            - FQ -> Keep Capital
        - 3. Time: Manage my time, relationships, etc. So I can spend the most time doing what I want and other people can do what they want
            - EQ -> Use Capital
    - What’s the value of PhD? It gives me the time and space to improve my skills that I can use for money later: Research Skills, AI Skills, Engineering Skills, QR Skills. As well as provides me with a network to find opportunities to turn my skills into Capital
        - Finance or Big Tech being the currently most lucrative
        - Start-ups too albeit with different reward profiles
    - Where do I currently fall short?
        - I don’t have good income, especially for my expenses - I should get a real job - school is an investments and all investments you should know the selling-out price
        - My recent managing of money has been horrendous and will take lots of mental time and energy to fix so I should maintain in regularly to prevent that
            - Get Cashflow in order
        - My Finance and QR knowledge is pretty bad, and this is a priority for both IQ and FQ reasons
        - A good graphic would be to show years and time of your life and how much it will cost to live at that time given inflation then from end forward buy years back, till you get to present day should only take 5-10 years
            - All things relevant to ai/robotics, travel, and ecosystem development save till that day, but curate into folders
    - This buying back procedure and curating for later gives a unifying metric (and thus shall be my new screensaver)
        - Optimize for spending the most uninterrupted time doing the things you want to do:
            - Retire by 2036 - Take care of Family financially
