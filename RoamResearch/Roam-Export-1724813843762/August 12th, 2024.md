        - Strategy 3: Epsilon
            - Strategy is two fold:
                - Do a large (coarse analysis) to small deep dive analysis on stocks to find some good short-medium terms stocks to hold from weeks to months. For these I need to define testable hypotheses and theories about the market and test them with pre-defined exit positions and period to manage risk (semi-automatically managed).
                - Run uncorrelated long-term portfolio, these holdings need to be managed automatically. For example, I want an uncorrelated NVIDIA portfolio that only provides returns based on NVIDIA's returns uncorrelated from the market.
