    - What matters and what doesn’t
        - For QF what matters is your ability to make money, not tech, not visualizations, not alt data pipelines
            - although the latter can really help, you should get really good at making money and automating process that directly make money or help
        - For robotics what matters is getting robots to do complicated things with little effort, understanding is important, philosophy is important, how stuff relates to consciousness, the brain, and what it means to be alive, but really at the end of the day more efficient production is what we want
            - Get good at making machines do your bidding
