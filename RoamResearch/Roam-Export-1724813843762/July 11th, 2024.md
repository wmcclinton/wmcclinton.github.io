- Todo:
    - Go to Boston
    - Go through storage (later)
    - Read Quantitative Value Book (later)
    - Done - Compute Correlations in Parallel - on notebook (ask Yael how to make script instead of notebook)
    - IMPORTANT - stick to paper Cohen and Frazzini 2006 so you are not looking in the dark - reproduce results first
    - Make plan for 2025 Internship Applications:
        - JaneStreet
        - Citadel
        - DE Shaw
        - RenTech
        - Millenium
        - Bridgewater
        - AQR
        - Two Sigma
        - Point 72
        - HRT
        - Arrow Street
        - Balyasny Asset Management
- [[Schonfeld]]
    - Get Portfolio Selection Book - Marcowitz
    - notes:
        - Ask Ryan:
            - Just accurately measuring global markets returns and volatility, and having diversified global portfolio levered up should result in really good returns  (simple Markowitz Mean-Variance Optimization): S&P500 + EIFA + etc.
                - One project would be to compute this myself - Globally Efficient Portfolio
                - What happens when you project this to a Barra Neutral signal?
    - gtsw1
        - also try:
            - only trade stocks we have supply chain information about
            - only trade on top and bottom quintile
            - do all customers not just >5% (alpha search this)
            - incorporate other relationships partners, suppliers, etc.
            - incorporate earnings info (PEAD)
            - make sure you are not fighting monthly mean reversion, maybe take last months returns a month ago - follow the paper exactly
    - presentation
        - before and after data loading
    - Most Important:
        - Yaelâ€™s happy with data loaders (NLN)
        - BNV GTS from any data on \opt\..\prod
        - My new GTS signals (high correlation with y.ym)
        - Alpha Search, tools for finding alpha - parallelizations
        - Other Less Important:
            - Q/kdb proficiency
                - certificate and project
            - Good Clear Final Presentation and Documentation
    - Goal Black Amex Centurion Card
