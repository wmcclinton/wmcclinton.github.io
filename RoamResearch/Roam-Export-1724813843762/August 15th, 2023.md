    - What future do you see:
        - One of near infinite abundance and expansion, but also balance, harmony, and equality
        - Create a compelling vision of the future
    - Look backward in your past to see the future
        - Harder for younger leaders
        - Recurring themes in your life:
            - AI/Automation
            - Technology
            - Decentralization
            - Hackathons/Startups
            - Unconventional Paths
    - 6 WFS Global Trends:
        -  demographics, economics, government, environment, society, and technology
    - Only Optimists survive
    - More time reading, talking, and thinking about the future
    - Train your emotional intelligence
    - The leader only coordinates the wants and desires of the rest of the group
    - My problem is I don’t talk enough about the idea and why I believe in it so much. I keep it secret to keep it safe, but this might be doing more harm than good
    - Leaders bring out the answers and best in others. Ask good questions, not have good answers
    - I'm on a good path: MIT PhD a couple good papers, VirtueAI and Aneta - Crypto, VirtueFin - Crypto Trading, and Genesis - IoT App and Device Marketplace + Development platform
        - Todo:
            - VirtueAI Lite Paper
            - Aneta V2
            - VirtueFin - cBTC arbitrage
                - [DONE] Mint cBTC to ADA address with python OP_RETURN
                - Use Selinium to swap cBTC with ADA on minswap https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/index.html
                - Then finally use lucid to send ADA to coinbase
            - Genesis - IoT Platform - MVP + Web editor plugin + System Diagram
                -  I think doing a mixture of bring other peoples content on our platform and getting our name/devices out there through the current marketplaces for now is what’s key
                - No actually the open sourceness and thingiverse type design was actually what I was going for. I didn’t necessarily want to make the parts just have them all in one space
    - Genesis will be good for cheap humanoids and quadrupeds too
    - Slept @3 doing cBTC arbitrage - figured out OP_RETURN
