        - Title: Alt Data Pipeline and Alpha Search
        - Sections:
            - Alt Data Pipeline
                - Alt Data Definition - anything not price or derived from price
                - Pipeline
                    - Vender gives data to Charm or directly to us in CSV or PARQUET
                    - We connect, identify and join it
                    - Dump it to our PARQUET file (which we can load to kdb)
                - Why? To get alpha
            - Alpha Search
                - Alpha Definition - any edge data or signal can give you over risk factors
                - Search Definition - finding a set of signals that fulfill some criteria in a much larger space of signals
                - Search Process:
                    - Load some processed alt data from ETL pipeline
                    - define space and run on signals (including factors)

                        - Correlations
                        - Heatmaps
                        - Alpha Decay
            - Directions of Improvement:
                - Add more alt data sets
                - Scale up to more Securities
                - Make more complicated signals (simple autoregression on order book data)
