        - You want to train ai/robot brain
        - depending on the shape of the brain it is easier or hard to train
        - for example, when training the eye part of the brain that’s connected to the eyes it is important that it knows that parts of things close to each other matter a lot more that pieces further away
        - transformers are a shape of the brain that says two things: no matter how far things are away they could be treated equally as important or even the father as more, and  how much they will we considered will figure out what matters by ... ???
