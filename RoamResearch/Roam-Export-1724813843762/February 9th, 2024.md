        - Sam to polish the deck
        - Classes
        - LIS
            - 2 Graphs - Compostionality + Transferablity
            - We have diffusion policy skills how do we use them
                - Assume we have a black box parametrized skill and a black box, Initiation set classifier and Termination set classifier
                - Assume we have goal predicate classifiers
                - Idea:
                    - take current predicate set and find the closest matching region (predicates that segment the space into the right shape)
                    - then create a predicate to fill in the gap (with the objects that matter) -> maybe generated from a grammar or learn and energy function
                    - For example your given a pouring skill or and insert skill
                        - ..
