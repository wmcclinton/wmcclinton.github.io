    - there are 2 reasons why I'm hestitant to join your starting team
        - 1 - I have 2 years to graduate and would thus find a way to balance the two which is especially hard in the final years
        - 2 - My friend has been working the last few semesters getting the agreements to do the same thing (hydro powered AI compute with government land grant and funding, with potential tokenization)
            - I don't know how comfortable each would be with me helping out the other - maybe I could consult for both - or maybe some type of merger could be brokered
            - They are also very flexible offering $10k a month on a part-time/consulting basis knowing finishing my PhD is very important to me, as well as a good chunk of equity (>10%)
