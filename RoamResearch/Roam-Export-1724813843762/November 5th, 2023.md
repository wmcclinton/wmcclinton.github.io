- I need a deeper study of economics for they sake of understanding the world. Try to make it more formalized tho
- I also want to make Leslie’s paper into an actual paper
    - Give our planning objective can we learn the representation by taking the gradient?
- Books: 1776-1976
    - Wealth of Nation - Smith
    - Principles - Ricardo
    - Principles - Mills
        - Mill was the last political economist
    - Principles - Marshall
    - Economics - Samuelson
- Deduction vs Induction (Precision vs Prediction)
    - Production - Deduction (governed by laws)
    - Distribution of Wealth - Induction (induced by our social institutions)
- Mills thought we’d get to a point where our only problem is distribution and not economic growth/progress
- I stood among but not of them - Lord Byron
- Writing is so important - don’t forget to practice and do it
- Write a summary and opinion on all chapters of New Ideas from Dead Economists
- Tradition of the dead generation weighs on the brain of the living
- The Battle is between the lords and the capitalists who’s prodigy become lords and fight the new capitalists
- History shuffles the deck and he who holds the king is beheaded
- The communist card game: Lords, Owners, and Serfs. One lord a few owners everyone else is serfs. Serfs produce (draw cards) and give it too the Owners who give it to the lords.
    - Serfs can try to cheat the system or play a guessing game
- Capitalism liberated people from worse conditions and socialism form the conditions of capitalism
- Constant vs Variable Capital is important
- the lean and hungry will eat into the profits of the fat and lazy
- Flexibility vs Economy of Scale - how big should you be
- A lot can be done by taking Alfred Marshall’s marginal economics theories and adding compute and simulation (for both demonstration and prediction)
- Nature will make no quick leaps the slow rind of evolution

- What is generalization:
    - typically is defined by success on an out of distribution task
    - to accurately test this you need to know your distribution the new test distribution and the metric space by which they differ, all which are fuzzy
    - and to make it even more hard there is no free lunch so any algorithm learning on its distribution cannot hope to generalize to all distributions
    - you can learn or model a distribution but then use that estimated distribution to check where data is in it or not will be the same as evaluating that learning method on the data
        - so to know whether it’s in or out of distribution you look at how well you model does on it
    - my take is that asking whether a model can generalize is asking some what of a wrong question, we should be asking how close are two distributions in the space we care about (I.e. what’s the analogy and how deep is the analogy) and to do that we need to know the distribution it’s like asking
