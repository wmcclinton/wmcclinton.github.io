    - melissa repko cnbc wallmart report
    - First Week:
        - I think I killed it! I made the base for the Alpha Search pipeline now need to start adding more alternative data and more symbols.
        - I should look into the 60 datasets that rusty has that I can explore with Athena
        - I should also figure out the supply chain dataset and add signal with those
        - Also finish FFC (missing HML) and plot alpha decay
    - This weekend BJJ and Relax, but if extra time:
        - WSQ finish problems
        - Make better Report print out
        - Read Ryanâ€™s financial analyst paper
        - Find EPS/SALES signal
    - Will be useful later:
        - https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.basinhopping.html
        - ^Define search space in parameter space them find params
            - process should be:
                - connect alternative data
                - define formulaic alpha and search space
                - find optimal alpha (via basin jumping) and visualize regions around it
                - refine and build actual strat then backtest
