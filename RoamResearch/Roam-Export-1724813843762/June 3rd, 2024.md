        - Shower Thoughts:
            - Thank parents for getting me a bucket of legos and a nxt mindstorm
            - Due to that I think that’s why programming came so natural to me
                - functions are like pieces that can fit together like Lego blocks to build what ever shape or function you desire
            - Also pushing me  academically (especially in math)
            - Starting to program in 5th grade at 10 years old with scratch is pretty impressive and in 6-8th grade with nxt
            - I had a head start
            - Thank my parents now that I’m helping people trade tens of millions of assets a day, I’m realising that some of these things only I can do
            - I’m feeling self actualization, realizing there are somethings that only I can do because of my experiences at such a young age legos, programming, math, Cs, people/neuroscience, AI
- [[Research]]
    - PhD worthy final questions
        - How does Operator Learning Scale with data, what are the theoretical limits. What about n-branch step search, full search hill-climbing, what about beam search?
            - Solve Behavior
            - How slow does it get? Parallelisation? Guarantees?
        - When and when won’t it work with black box skills and a demo?
            - Aloha-like demo
        - Journal Paper
