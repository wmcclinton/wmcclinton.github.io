- 10am BD Meeting
- Think about Alpha Discovery:
    - 1. pick security -> on all securities
    - 2. define indicator/alpha -> search over all indicators (not possible)
    - 3. test alpha
        - with respect to market
        - with respect to current portfolio
    - Spilt the problem into 2:
        - alpha discovery
        - alpha testing, all securities with constraints, when does signal/alpha die
