            - Strategy is two fold:
                - Do a large (coarse analysis) to small deep dive analysis on stocks to find some good short-medium terms stocks to hold from weeks to months. For these I need to define testable hypotheses and theories about the market and test them with pre-defined exit positions and period to manage risk (semi-automatically managed).
                - Run uncorrelated long-term portfolio, these holdings need to be managed automatically. For example, I want an uncorrelated NVIDIA portfolio that only provides returns based on NVIDIA's returns uncorrelated from the market.

    - look at FileCoin lite paper
    - Build your foundation, your core values brick by brick, decide them, be them, live them
    - Context vs Content
    - You can’t do it alone - Trust is important
    - Leaders lead by example, your asking people to spend most of there time working for the companies, but you aren’t doing the same
    - Everything you need you already have it’s about taking the first step: a heart, a brain, courage
    - I resonate with the people at Aneta’s goal to take down the modern financial system, banks shouldn’t be investing our money we should. AI shouldn’t be owned or gate keeper by anyone, people should have the liberty to use it
    - Brainwash yourself: decentralization, liberty, ai, internet, bitcoin, writings of tim Berber’s lee, (Vint Cerf inspired you)
    - Think about what you are an expert in and fix pain points in that and using that
    - Worry less, say what you mean. Just do and ask for forgiveness
    - As AI tools get more and more powerful, the role of decentralized governance will become more and more important - I care about that

    - What future do you see:
        - One of near infinite abundance and expansion, but also balance, harmony, and equality
        - Create a compelling vision of the future
    - Look backward in your past to see the future
        - Harder for younger leaders
        - Recurring themes in your life:
            - AI/Automation
            - Technology
            - Decentralization
            - Hackathons/Startups
            - Unconventional Paths
    - 6 WFS Global Trends:
        -  demographics, economics, government, environment, society, and technology
    - Only Optimists survive
    - More time reading, talking, and thinking about the future
    - Train your emotional intelligence
    - The leader only coordinates the wants and desires of the rest of the group
    - My problem is I don’t talk enough about the idea and why I believe in it so much. I keep it secret to keep it safe, but this might be doing more harm than good
    - Leaders bring out the answers and best in others. Ask good questions, not have good answers
    - I'm on a good path: MIT PhD a couple good papers, VirtueAI and Aneta - Crypto, VirtueFin - Crypto Trading, and Genesis - IoT App and Device Marketplace + Development platform
        - Todo:
            - VirtueAI Lite Paper
            - Aneta V2
            - VirtueFin - cBTC arbitrage
                - [DONE] Mint cBTC to ADA address with python OP_RETURN
                - Use Selinium to swap cBTC with ADA on minswap https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/index.html
                - Then finally use lucid to send ADA to coinbase
            - Genesis - IoT Platform - MVP + Web editor plugin + System Diagram
                -  I think doing a mixture of bring other peoples content on our platform and getting our name/devices out there through the current marketplaces for now is what’s key
                - No actually the open sourceness and thingiverse type design was actually what I was going for. I didn’t necessarily want to make the parts just have them all in one space
    - Genesis will be good for cheap humanoids and quadrupeds too
    - Slept @3 doing cBTC arbitrage - figured out OP_RETURN

        - Jeremy had great thoughts. Thought HBS people were not good for startups (biased), but agree. He imagines having a single application to recommend better connection and integration of devices. He sees the limitation of devices, and limitation of having a single layer solution, but sees the value proposition of having a place where users can put in their devices and get recommendations for optimization, or anything that tackles the user experiences of the device

    - Maybe you just want to be a quant
    - Need more time to do cBTC arb bot (Maybe tmrw)
    - This weekend (including friday) prepare for your interview
        - Start by going through all vides and making cheat sheet. (Recording everything would be nice too)
        - Finish WSQ project - answer old project questions
        - Study cheat sheet, do practice problems
    - Maybe perfect school year is pursue start-ups 20hrs, HBS course 10hrs, and study/read for quant rounds 10hrs, Research/BD 20hrs, Exercise and chill the rest of the time
    - Actually plot out earnings of different paths: Google vs Citadel vs Startup
    - Only way out of this shit show is through a startup, but FAANG or Quant can by sometime and security. So end goal is break capitalism, to do that I need to escape the rat race so startup/businesses, to do that I need time and security potentially work a few years like you did google
        - Worked at google, did Masters went broke, then did quant exited the rat race, then did PhD/startup
        - VirtueAI or Genesis will be breakout, and the break capitalism through robotics
    - Since Rohan got $350000 offer if I get that or more I’ll dropout

    - What are you passionate about? AI decision making with data, automation, crypto and decentralization, and markets
    - How to make money as a roboticist
    - Maybe sell robocoin
    - Maybe focus on working and starting a robotics startup instead of quant
    - I realized that I can work my way up the business/robotics later - only roboticist interested in crypto dev - and opening so solving simple problems
        - like Sev said
        - Genesis might be a good startup start or AI Coin
        - Leslie’s Marketplace of models
    - If I get a quant internship then I’ll try if not I’ll intern at robotics places:
        - Tesla AI
        - Amazon Robotics
        - Nvidia
        - Figure
        - etc
    - AIcoin/ibit can be used to query Detic and Sam models
        - Detic and Sam are open source just need people to run them
    - Genesis is device marketplace and VirtueAI is model marketplace
    - I can let the researchers do research, the devs do development, and the engineers engineer solutions. I will just make the glue/marketplaces (keep it simple)
        - Real AI/Robotics/IoT is probably 10-20 years out but getting ahead of the curve will be great
            - competing with likes of google and amazon though might not be good, but any share of this growing market would be great
            - Helps decentralize AI research
            - May just give others ability to run lots of AI models
            - Offering an alternative is good, doesn’t have to be the only way or cheapest
    - What’s the simplest way to do ^^^ MVP model marketplace - run a model get multiple queries of network compare and send payment
    - it’s an infinite game, make the world better, explore with friends
    - Save, get quant, go to south east Asia, make more companies
    - Make point 72 study plan:
        - Sat/Sun
        - Project, Videos, etc?

    - Challenges of AI:
        - Learning representations and predictive models
        - Learning to reason
        - Learning to plan complex actions to achieve objectives
    - You would just do research all day if you could, but you need to feed yourself and buy a house etc.
    - SGD can be seen as a type of search (with poorly understood heuristics) over the potential programs a Neural Network can take and the deeper the more able the program to closely approximate the program you want which is the Kolmogorov compressor of the data (because compression is equal to prediction). This connects the theoretical understanding of supervised learning and connects it to a theoretical objective for unsupervised learning.

    - When I talk to Sev and complain about the 6+ things I'm doing and say I have no time. She says pick one or your fail at all of them, and my heart mind and soul all react "No" out of a deep feeling to prove everyone wrong. Forcing my hand to sacrifice more and more for bigger and bigger ambitions

August 1st, 2024

- Finish Alphas / Presentation
- Email about 2 classes
    - Graduate Asset Pricing
    - Personal Finance
- Study Citadel:
    - Do https://leetcode.com/problems/regular-expression-matching/
- [[Schonfeld]][[Life]]
    - Finally understand Risk Models
        - Stat Arb vs the Economists
        - Does adding factors make predicting return streams easier or harder?
        - They are both right
        - Stat Arb thinks about the problem as the risks are lol IR and hard to predict thus lets only predict idio
        - Economists think RISKs are the only persistent, explainable, alpha or bets
        - Tomorrows Beta is tomorrows Alpha
        - French and Fama:
            - Factors as better predictions, so we can leverage the factors for more predictable return
        - Stat Arb:
            - Factors as Risk, so we can capitalize on idio/alpha because it's easier to predict and less volatile
        - Side Note:
            - Diversification in Time
            - Seisure as a market crash, phase lock all time scales ^
            - Selling your Book - Cooperative Strats/market manipulation vs. Competitive where sharing has market decay 
        - If you run PCA on data, bigger factors are easier to predict
        - As more people acknowledge the Risk Factors and leverage returns for it the volatility goes up and IR goes down, 
            - Or does it go up because we are all doing the same thing
        - Economist and Stat Arb are kinda doing the same thing looking for that next thing that explains alpha - I would say the difference is whether they share it 1. and 2. the typical time horizon they care about (maybe)
        - Mosaic
    - If you have a signal and make it orthogonal to Barra can it be better at predicting future returns or is it always worse 
    - I’m such a beginner, so much to learn (Ryan Alder definitely has 2+ years of experience and it shows)
    - Potential Ideas for [[Schonfeld]] continuation:
        - Transformers for Price Data (Also related Asset Embeddings, Overfitting/Training LLMs, Big Data)
        - Original 10000 equities project Correlations at scale with GPU - just weight basic one historic correlations
        - Deep Learning for Stat Arb
            - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.04028
            - https://cfe.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/content/slides/MarkusPelger_Slides%20Deep%20Learning%20Statistical%20Arbitrage.pdf
            - 
        - (Interest) Modeling Drawdowns (Also related Black Swan events)
        - (Interest) Better Risk Models - Barra From Scratch (Also related Conforment prediction)
        - (Interest) Quantum Arb
    - The Brain at least the neocortex is a large table of correlations and decentralized memory that caches the statistical properties of the the world, and acts as a tool for our base desires / lizard brain which maintains our homeostasis and reproductive capabilities
        - this model of the world model internal sensations and phenomena too, as well as even meta properties about the system itself - where the ability to model oneself is conscience which is not a true or falsity but a scale
        - evolution is happening to everything homeostasis and stability is the fitness criteria and every since molecule to lizard brain to cortex is pursuit of that

- Concept:
    - Prediction Market
        - Give people credits 
        - They can trade on the market
        - based on performance they get more credits (you can have them paper trade)
        - Then if you are in the top performer on the trading game you get rewards money
        - In the backend we can either  (1.) sell data, (2.) we take the risk and trade with the top to performers

- Email interviewer back thanking him for his patience and apologizing for being a bit slow since I’m on vacation in Amsterdam
- [[Trading Notes]] 
    - Don’t distill wrong lessons from experience will take a lot to relearn - trends vs wisdom 
    - A lot of bets are loses not because of choosing the wrong direction but by not taking a large enough bet
    - Most of trading can be understood as protecting against risk (not only capitalizing on gains)
        - Stop loss is life saving - remember how you lost $10k in one day

December 14th, 2023

- If I’m allowed to think deeply for myself:
    - Away from the boyz and my wife, and my family, and all the haters and supporters
    - I would realize I think money doesn’t matter I’ve seen google, I’ve seen MIT, I’ll see quant, I’ve seen what money can buy and what it can’t: Time, Youth, Love, Knowledge. Their are somethings right now and in the future that are infinitely valuable like your autonomy, life, truth, and hope. And tech that can make more of those infinitely powerful things Autonomy, Life, Truth, and Hope. Space is coming, Energy is coming, Intelligence is coming. 
    - PhD was great and is great, but I’m using it as a crutch as a place to play around and test out ideas in the comfort of my lab.
    - Quantitative Research is sexy and great, amazing game with so much intellectual problems. Markets are beautiful and would love to live the lavished life.
    - But when it comes to it the path of my own making is the best one, maybe those closest to me won’t understand and may think I’m crazy, and I might be. But it’s being pulling me every since I was little in high school I levitated to actual solutions to actual problems people care about. I love ideas, research, and philosophy but I can only stomach so much without having to get my hands dirty. I’m not an intellectual I’m an engineer, I’m not a business man I’m an engineer, but I can pretend to be an intellectual and pretend to be a business man. But when it comes down to it I want my autonomy and I want to solve the hard problems, I think I’m way more valuable than a few hundred thousand dollar seven tho people may not see that right now.
    - I do think it’s foolish to try to do all 3 things well. Life is long though so I should think about time frames.
    - Grow-up enter the real world and figure out how money works.
    - People are willing to spend billions of dollars on AI, Automation, Robotics, Energy, Quantum Computing, Biotech why because the pay off is ginormous literally unfathomable
    - We believe, as Richard Feynman said, “Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts.”

December 1st, 2023

- Time
- Money
- And Value are everything
- Time cannot be made but can be traded for Money or Value
- Money can buy others Time or sellable Value
    - Money can be printed by anyone
- Value is created via Time and Creativity
- You start with a Lifetime of time you want Value
    - you need to spend money to survive
- A Value to money trade is half a trade where Value to Value is the full, money is only a medium. you trade with expectation that you can buy more valuable things
- Every choice should be thought of how much would someone need to pay you or you need to bay someone to have this thing of Value - that is it’s price or current value
- Some things have infinite or negative infinite value and calculus with these is hard infinity + infinity = infinity but negative infinity + infinity is undefined 
    - infinity - infinity is also undefined
- People will optimise their holdings to maximise present and future value, that trade off of having a thing now versus the future is also a value (present value)
- Most mistakes in life are about lack of information what markets exist what are their prices:
    - some things have no markets
    - some things have much better markets than you think
    - value of information is hard to gauge
- Find the things which are infinite negative and positive value (these are your hard constraints)
    - you can’t do calculus with them
- Life has constraints you don’t have infinite time or money. And most people have an negative infinite value constraint on dying and not being fed. Even thought unintuitive find the saving amount or annual salary that’s like neg infinite value if you go below it might be zero. Logic might be if I didn’t have this much money now I would not be able to feed me or my family thus I should never dip below that point.
    - people tend to do infinite calculus and say something like well if I get something infinitely valuable after this negative infinite I will balance out or be in a better position, but that’s not true it’s undefined we don’t know which infinite is bigger
- Timing of having value is important but less important than avoiding get stuck in infinite value calculus. Also present value can help with these decisions
- Lastly, if you can ever buy infinite value with finite money buy it or avoid negative infinite value  by paying pay it, these are your spending hopes and where most of your money should go.These are your sink states. Be reasonable and buy at market rate tho even though it’s infinites. Also always avoid infinite calculus.
- 
- if it doesn’t refine EPT should be infinity not 0

- Wouldn’t be too hard to make fully differentiable planning work with continuous actions
- conjecture: sufficiently deep enough state vector handles non deterministic models i.e. state distribution instead of states
- you need an objective and architecture for example masking objective works for learning distributions of patterns discrete symbolic chunks only with Transformers. We have an object now we just need an architecture
- Maybe objective and architecture are the same thing like maybe a slightly more complex masking objective might work with vanilla nns

    - I want to build something as fluid as Uber
- Question for Eso:
    - On Backtesting:
        - In robotics it’s hard to much without a simulator, it is possible to build adaptive policies that generalize off of one demo but this requires a lot of intuition and work on the designers end.
        - A lot of modern robotics get around policy design by using a simulator. We embed physics which we can simulate in side and engine that we can try different things and then during execution either succeed out the gate with polices that are robust to the simulation or two learn how to adapt our policies by estimating the parameters of our simulator first than optimizing online
        - My question is there a notion of a simulator for testing signals, I know it might not make sense to consider all worlds (similarly we don’t assume being robust and simulating all different types of physics in our simulator) but given some economical law as about the market which some changeable parameters we can simulate different markets instead of just backtesting on one dataset. This will allow us to test robustness too
        - Example what about a world where 2008 was a bit later or people we slightly more conservative or bullish.

        - ^ I like this, are their interesting projects to test if something like this would be useful. In robotics we know a simulator is useful by executing a policy that is learned from the simulator and see if it works in the real world we can compare traditional backtest vs. robust backtest (via our simulator) in how they overfit or probability they will overfit similar to this paper:

        - Setting is you assume that you have a working operator theory and you have to learn a new predicate/predicates that you know you can toggle (look at the data) for a new black box policy, then you take a step of our predicate invention and operator learning to learn it.
            - We assume a basis set of predicates, operators, skills, and samplers
            - We assume we have long horizon demos (of many different tasks as well as ones containing the skill we want to learn), a new skill we want to learn, and a goal classifier
            - Run predicate invention and operator learning, show we might need beam search

    - and so you can use different data
- All signals define a portfolio and my returns of portfolio can be regressed against other portfolio to see how my returns are explained by their returns. if my portfolio is different it is called alpha, but now my alpha generating portfolio can be thought of as another risk factor:
    - can’t we just regress on the linear combination of all signals/portfolios/risk factors ???
        - than alpha would be 0
        - the question now becomes what risk factors are other people using “I.e. that matter” and what combination will I use that’s different

- Im going to join a market-neural team who does exactly what we communicated in class
    - get a big risk factor model from a vendor
    - then define signals/starts and find alpha
    - but if every signal defines a portfolio than I don’t understand the difference between alpha and beta, for example I define an UMD signal (Momemntum) and find with some parameters it generates alpha what prevents me from making/calling that risk factor
        - I think it’s just a conceptual problem I have
    - Is it risk factors are what we are trying to control for and alpha is what we can provide
    - are than the huge collection of risk factors that we get just a list of know alphas the market will most likely exploit
- What is ur personal take of UMD

- Junto Questions
    - Casual Causality - Alex’s 
        - “ Have a chalkboard at my apartment and drinks. Just give me an attainable time and date and we can do this.” 
            - Teach us Causality
        - “ Causal effects only make sense for variables you can intervene on. But the space of variables that can be conceivably intervened on is small compared to all of reality. So, in causal discovery work (or robotics etc.) how to you tell the difference.” Brain Teaser
            - Why does anything else matter

        - …
    - Radical Markets
        - …
        - …
    - Discursivity of non-Philosophical Thought
        - “The technical term I believe is discursive, yes. Unlike philosophy more generally (though there are some that think philosophy is discursive, which seems absurd to me, but I digress).”
        - “So we need a way of measuring truthiness for statements neither empirical nor tautological”
        - “Lol. Good luck with that. This is measure without a metric.”
        - What’s good:
            - The point can be made further by two Greek words: gnosis and philosophy. That is knowledge (gnosis) and philosophy (love of wisdom). If one knows the truth, the only thing left is to implement, not to research. So, the first act of the Scientist in my view is not to go and seek something out towards operational change, but rather to observer. Here we see a similarity with the fine arts.
            - This really should be a 4h discussion over some sort of drink, because the topic is too deep for typing. lol
            - Happiness Metric and Beatific Visions
            - Immiseration of Students
            - Etymology of Happiness
    - The Science Problem
        - “ So all the science and math is for what? A path in this unknowable venture”
        - “ It's why religious liberty is such a stress by people like Locke. It's not a devaluing of these questions, but a demarcation of their importance.”
        - “ Philosophy of love is a criminally under explored area by serious thinkers.”
        - Here's a moral thought experiment: would you rather have your father be tortured or be the torturer?
        - Antagonistic social theories have done a lot of damage, I suspect. Not only are they corrosive, but they're technically not right.

    - Figure out goals and screensaver
- Goals
    - I want be an intelligent investor, have money and spend my days building things: brains, house, ecosystems
    - To do that I need:
        - 1. Capital: Cash, Assets etc.
            - IQ -> Get Capital
        - 2. Know-How: To manage it, make more from it, not lose it all, etc.
            - FQ -> Keep Capital
        - 3. Time: Manage my time, relationships, etc. So I can spend the most time doing what I want and other people can do what they want
            - EQ -> Use Capital
    - What’s the value of PhD? It gives me the time and space to improve my skills that I can use for money later: Research Skills, AI Skills, Engineering Skills, QR Skills. As well as provides me with a network to find opportunities to turn my skills into Capital
        - Finance or Big Tech being the currently most lucrative
        - Start-ups too albeit with different reward profiles
    - Where do I currently fall short?
        - I don’t have good income, especially for my expenses - I should get a real job - school is an investments and all investments you should know the selling-out price
        - My recent managing of money has been horrendous and will take lots of mental time and energy to fix so I should maintain in regularly to prevent that
            - Get Cashflow in order
        - My Finance and QR knowledge is pretty bad, and this is a priority for both IQ and FQ reasons
        - A good graphic would be to show years and time of your life and how much it will cost to live at that time given inflation then from end forward buy years back, till you get to present day should only take 5-10 years
            - All things relevant to ai/robotics, travel, and ecosystem development save till that day, but curate into folders
    - This buying back procedure and curating for later gives a unifying metric (and thus shall be my new screensaver)
        - Optimize for spending the most uninterrupted time doing the things you want to do:
            - Retire by 2036 - Take care of Family financially
            - Build an AI, Brain, Assistant, Helper
                - 10 years

    - Me:
        - I want to complete this analogy "Convolutional Neural Networks" are to "the local receptive fields of neurons in the visual cortex" as "Transformers" are to 
    - ChatGPT:
        - "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are to the local receptive fields of neurons in the visual cortex as Transformers are to the distributed attention mechanisms in human cognition."
        - Here's an explanation of this analogy:
        - CNNs and Visual Cortex:
            - Local Receptive Fields: In the visual cortex, neurons are sensitive to specific regions of the visual field, detecting localized features such as edges, colors, and textures. This is analogous to the way convolutional layers in CNNs use filters to detect features in portions of the input image.
            - Hierarchical Processing: The visual cortex processes visual information in a hierarchical manner, with different layers of neurons responding to increasingly complex features. CNNs mimic this hierarchical structure, with deeper layers combining the features detected by earlier layers to recognize more complex patterns.
        - Transformers and Distributed Attention Mechanisms:
            - Distributed Attention: Human cognition, particularly in tasks involving language and memory, utilizes distributed attention mechanisms. These mechanisms selectively focus on different parts of the input information (like words in a sentence or elements in a sequence) and relate them to each other regardless of their position.
            - Transformers' Attention Mechanism: Similarly, the core mechanism of Transformers is the attention mechanism, specifically the self-attention component. This allows the model to weigh and relate different parts of the input data (such as different words in a sentence), regardless of their sequential position. It helps the model to understand the context and the relationships between elements in the input.
        - In summary, while CNNs mimic the localized and hierarchical processing of the visual cortex ideal for spatial data like images, Transformers emulate the distributed and context-aware processing of human cognition, making them highly effective for sequential data like text or time series.
    - How does Distributed Attention relate to planning? 
- Research:
    - RSS
        - Write Appendix (CogMan)
    - ICML/IROS
        - Fully Differentiable TAMP
        - Fix Theory
        - Implement Empirically on Grid World Tasks
            - Model Based - Behavior Cloning
                - vs typical Behavior Cloning
        - Beat BC Baselines
    - CoLLA
        - Thesis wants: finish and turn into a paper, learn on behavior and show composition and transfer
        - See Thesis plan prior to thesis:

            - 
- Predicators + Aloha
    - Problem
        - Predicators does TAMP but needs hand-coded skills even if Predicators and Operators are given
            - Can induce these from skills
        - Aloha gives a nice infrastructure to learn shortish policies from imitation learning data
    - Soultion
        - Learn Policies with Aloha, Handwrite predicates and induce operators
            - samplerless
        - Plan to Practice when free, otherwise accomplish human given goals
            - if fail try to replan, if stuck ask for help finishing the current skill - add to demos
        - On new demos rerun imitation learning
        - To bootstrap learning help with lowest competence skill
    - How
        - Skills learn via Imitation Learning like in Aloha
        - Predicates are Hand Written from object oriented SAM+Detic System
        - Use SeSaMe (CogMan - Replanning System)
    - Next Problem
        - Now that it is learning and achieving long range behavior how do you use the data collected to demonstrate how to over come failures
            - like if a skill is doing poorly and not getting better by practicing you can give it more demos
        - LLMs turn language into predicates and turn errors and asks into Natural Language
            - Might be cool to answer questions about state or say why they are doing something (necessary effects)

    - Ambiguity Aversion - two urns one with 50 red balls and 50 blue balls or one with just red and blue balls
    - If we were perfectly rational then we wouldn’t need all this rational analysis to begin with to manage our irrationality, uncertainty, and bias (Thaler)
    - If people are so predictably irrational why aren’t smart people rich
    - Endowment Effect
    - Alphanomics:
        - during the first class he handed out a little sheet of paper and asked to write the number of what you think is 2/3's the average of the numbers the entire class would write down. This is a well know problem in behavior theory when "if" we were all rational we would write 0 because that's what we'd all converge too if a group of rational agents thought long and har about this, but that's a big if, you have those who don't understand the game, those lazy in their calculations, and even those vindictive people who will just right 100 for the fun of it. I being a student of behavior theory and game theory myself knew that studies show that "k=2" that people tend to ask the question "well what if the other person did that in response to thinking about my choice" on average around two times. For example, the average from 0-100 is 50 so 2/3 would be 33.3, well what if the everyone chose 33.3 in response to thinking about everyone else's choice, so I should write 2/3 of 33.3 which is 22.2, well what if the everyone chose 22.2 in response to thinking about everyone else's choice in this way as well, then I should write 2/3 of 22.2 which is 14.8, well what if .... On average after the second run of this people would stop so at 22.2 thus I wrote 14 thinking I was a genius.
        - The next week he announced the results and the answer was 13.7 and the winner wrote 12.8 - it was closest without going over. Frustrated I asked the guy how he got 12.8 and he said I 33.3 was to obvious so I kinda guessed. That's when I learned my first lesson, not that people are irrational but that even though people are irrational you still might lose acting rationally only, with a rational edge as well as many many times at bat as well can you come close

    - there are 2 reasons why I'm hestitant to join your starting team
        - 1 - I have 2 years to graduate and would thus find a way to balance the two which is especially hard in the final years
        - 2 - My friend has been working the last few semesters getting the agreements to do the same thing (hydro powered AI compute with government land grant and funding, with potential tokenization)
            - I don't know how comfortable each would be with me helping out the other - maybe I could consult for both - or maybe some type of merger could be brokered
            - They are also very flexible offering $10k a month on a part-time/consulting basis knowing finishing my PhD is very important to me, as well as a good chunk of equity (>10%)

    - X (easy) Address Terrys comment’s
    - X [DO] (easy) Slide 9: Results of 3 Pipelines and Visuals of 3 datasets
    - [Th/Do] (hard) Slide 13: add Supply Chain data visual and reproduced table

- [[Schonfeld]][[Life]][[Robotics]]
    - What matters and what doesn’t
        - For QF what matters is your ability to make money, not tech, not visualizations, not alt data pipelines
            - although the latter can really help, you should get really good at making money and automating process that directly make money or help
        - For robotics what matters is getting robots to do complicated things with little effort, understanding is important, philosophy is important, how stuff relates to consciousness, the brain, and what it means to be alive, but really at the end of the day more efficient production is what we want
            - Get good at making machines do your bidding

July 3rd, 2024

- Todo:
    - Read, Read, Read, make note and find signals
- [[Schonfeld]]
    - The process of finding a signal
        - Inspirations:
            - Quantpedia
            - SSRN
            - Papers
        - The Data
            - Visualize the returns you want to predict, alongside the data you have - transform the data into different scalars for each concept so it’s visualized well - either raw or detrended is fine
        - The Holes
            - Try to see what parts of the signal are correlated and what parts are not for each different data
            - How can they be systematically combined to match the data
                - it’s like a puzzle where every data can be: x, +, floored, ceiling, temporally shifted backwards
        - The Explanation
            - Now that you have a match why does it make sense, you are capitalizing on a market misallocation. Which one of these explains it:
                - behavioral factor
                - paid for risk
                - information advantage
                - liquidity providing
        - The Testing
            - Now run your stats and visualizations to see if your signal is robust
            - Finally when all parameters are fixed and chosen run backtest
        - Important Note:
            - What’s important in all of these is simplicity, reframe from complex data/ signals, complex compositions of them, weird esoteric explanations, and crazy testing strategies / parameter finding

    - You need to prove to yourself that you can make money, that you are worth the half million dollar offer:
        - This takes finding new alpha
        - Implementing it
        - And executing/following thru well
        - Note: you can do it in these internship, or you can do it at home with crypto, equities, etc
    - Schonfeld and I have a symbiotic relationship, I get to play around with cool ideas that Ryan and I dream up, and see if we can make money with them. I learn about all the important stuff the team does and they get to learn from my exploration and tinkering. My goal beyond them is to make GTS a money making machine (new outfitted alpha/gts), additional alt data handling - simple to test and mess around with new signals and get visualization

        - Title: Alt Data Pipeline and Alpha Search
        - Sections:
            - Alt Data Pipeline
                - Alt Data Definition - anything not price or derived from price
                - Pipeline
                    - Vender gives data to Charm or directly to us in CSV or PARQUET
                    - We connect, identify and join it
                    - Dump it to our PARQUET file (which we can load to kdb)
                - Why? To get alpha
            - Alpha Search
                - Alpha Definition - any edge data or signal can give you over risk factors
                - Search Definition - finding a set of signals that fulfill some criteria in a much larger space of signals
                - Search Process:
                    - Load some processed alt data from ETL pipeline
                    - define space and run on signals (including factors)
                    - See cool things:
                        - Traditional Stats
                        - Correlations
                        - Heatmaps
                        - Alpha Decay
            - Directions of Improvement:
                - Add more alt data sets
                - Scale up to more Securities
                - Make more complicated signals (simple autoregression on order book data)

    - First Week:
        - I think I killed it! I made the base for the Alpha Search pipeline now need to start adding more alternative data and more symbols.
        - I should look into the 60 datasets that rusty has that I can explore with Athena
        - I should also figure out the supply chain dataset and add signal with those
        - Also finish FFC (missing HML) and plot alpha decay
    - This weekend BJJ and Relax, but if extra time:
        - WSQ finish problems
        - Make better Report print out
        - Read Ryan’s financial analyst paper

- Whats the future of markets look like:
    - AI, Blockchain, Robotics
        - 1. Foundation Models Everywhere
        - 2. Crypto used by everyone
        - 3. Automation providing goods and services
    - Buy tokenised automation - given by a coin
        - fill a wallet for a process and that process turns that into a resource. Then pay that coin to get that resource in the future
    - It’s all about connecting points - how do AI connect with digital ecosystems - how do AIs connect with the world - how do digital ecosystems connect with the world
    - oracles are important. opposite of oracles are important too (ie actuators). turn on chain votes into real world actions.
    - AI specialty
    - Quant Job
    - Crypto and Hobby Robotics - hobby
        - upload data get tokens that you can use to pay for robot life and robot mines by living it’s life too by sharing data with the cloud. Learning happens with this closed data and robots mind gets updated, adding value to the network.

Economist typically stay away from this data being outside of the realm of what they can deal with bout now with information technology, NLP, CV, and AI we can potential turn this data into numerical data we can deal with it and use platforms to capture sentiment and the stories we are telling ourselves in semi-real-time

    - Make Sheet
- Stock game:
    - separate deck into: A, J, Q, K (face cards)  and 2-10 (number cards)
    - shuffle number cards and flip cards until you see a black:
        - that is the starting price for the day
            - * $100
        - continue to flip cards over these are percentage up or down each hour for 8hrs (cards) after the starting price
    - after each flip of a card: play the Ace or Queen to buy at a price and Jack or King to sell respectively.
    - If you don’t sell by the end you get the closing price
    - you can play Ace and Queen at the same time to double down
    - play until someone gets to $200 or someone goes bankrupt (start with $100)
    - 2 players each player gets 2 sets of face cards if 3-4 each player gets 1 set if 5-8 each player gets 1 pair of face cards
- Multi regression to portfolio returns of risk factors
    - every signal defines a series of portfolios which has a price that defines returns
    - you can find the price of a portfolio by a weighting of arrow debreau securities
        - so a return is you have some weighting at t and then have some other weighting at t+1, the difference of the return
        - EMH means no arbitrage at each t
        - let’s take each stock as an arrow debreau security -> you shouldn’t have more factors than you have stocks???

    - After not passing my Nova Prospect interview
    - I’m reflecting on my decisions

    - WSQ cheat sheet - briefly look over
    - Review Project and potential changes 2:30-3:00pm
        - WSQ Final Call:
            - Feedback on Project
                - No need to normalize 
                - returns = (diff return) / returns
                - Remove normalized returns
                - sqrt(252) not just len(returns)
                - might want to fill
                - don't need to resample by the day
                - purfication as when you calculate sharpes to 252
                - cheating look ahead bias
                - Part 2:
                    - fixed return computation should be a percentage
                    - shift signal by 1, you have a look ahead bias
                    - still have len in sharpes
                    - strev should be (/ not -) for combined high and combined low
                    - turn convex optimization to a loop with continous rebalancing everyday
                - Phrasing Quant Internship is important
                - Quick Feedback:

- Focus:
    - Deciding what your going to suck at
- 
- 
- 
- 
- USD Stability (USDS):
    - Algorithmic Stable Coins have failed horribly
    - This is due to thinking about getting early members rich as opposed to maintaining stability of the peg above all else
        - you need a mechanism of incentives members to maintain the peg and be there for the long run, but that comes second to the stability of the coin
    - [They messed up ](https://www.business.rutgers.edu/business-insights/thought-leadership-what-happened-terra-luna-and-can-it-happen-again)
    - Similar design as Terra Luna but over collateralise like MakerDAO
        -  you can stake: USDT, USDC, or ETH
        - to get stability token
        - Similar trading mechanics to Uniswap with stables
    - Things to maintain stability:
        - overstaked - stake lock
        - supply/demand - max mint amount
        - incentives - token holders want to keep price
        - Reserves
    - As stakers get rewards if protocol remains same or grows, if the pool shrinks it is sign of instability and stakers will proportionally lose collateral
    - stability coins are burnable to get that collateral - at a certain burn rate - you only get half the arbitrage tho the rest goes to reserves

    - Hey Willie, I think you can try to go with the first project. It is a topic of interest these days -- applying ML to order book data, so will look good on next year apps. You don't have to finish the entire project, but just getting some part of it done during the summer and having it on your resume is okay. Even if you just set up the data and construct some features, that could be enough. If you do go down that route, I would recommend trying to do it on at least a few hundred stocks though. Also, I would try to find a few other papers. General idea is deep learning + order book data to predict future returns.  You've already done some factor stuff for your project so it should be good to diversify. Then when comes interviews you can speak to both topics, and they're fairly complementary.

- Formulate our entire planning objective and representations as a big NN and optimisation problem. Talk about how hard coding a representation is like freezing a part of the network. This defines a nice space to search over with finite predicates and actions, in a continuous state space
- Think about Leslie’s continuous state space problem
- Read Graph NN expressivity paper

- I need a deeper study of economics for they sake of understanding the world. Try to make it more formalized tho
- I also want to make Leslie’s paper into an actual paper
    - Give our planning objective can we learn the representation by taking the gradient?
- Books: 1776-1976
    - Wealth of Nation - Smith
    - Principles - Ricardo
    - Principles - Mills
        - Mill was the last political economist
    - Principles - Marshall
    - Economics - Samuelson
- Deduction vs Induction (Precision vs Prediction)
    - Production - Deduction (governed by laws)
    - Distribution of Wealth - Induction (induced by our social institutions)
- Mills thought we’d get to a point where our only problem is distribution and not economic growth/progress
- I stood among but not of them - Lord Byron
- Writing is so important - don’t forget to practice and do it
- Write a summary and opinion on all chapters of New Ideas from Dead Economists
- Tradition of the dead generation weighs on the brain of the living
- The Battle is between the lords and the capitalists who’s prodigy become lords and fight the new capitalists
- History shuffles the deck and he who holds the king is beheaded
- The communist card game: Lords, Owners, and Serfs. One lord a few owners everyone else is serfs. Serfs produce (draw cards) and give it too the Owners who give it to the lords.
    - Serfs can try to cheat the system or play a guessing game
- Capitalism liberated people from worse conditions and socialism form the conditions of capitalism
- Constant vs Variable Capital is important
- the lean and hungry will eat into the profits of the fat and lazy
- Flexibility vs Economy of Scale - how big should you be
- A lot can be done by taking Alfred Marshall’s marginal economics theories and adding compute and simulation (for both demonstration and prediction)
- Nature will make no quick leaps the slow rind of evolution
- 
- What is generalization:
    - typically is defined by success on an out of distribution task
    - to accurately test this you need to know your distribution the new test distribution and the metric space by which they differ, all which are fuzzy
    - and to make it even more hard there is no free lunch so any algorithm learning on its distribution cannot hope to generalize to all distributions
    - you can learn or model a distribution but then use that estimated distribution to check where data is in it or not will be the same as evaluating that learning method on the data
        - so to know whether it’s in or out of distribution you look at how well you model does on it
    - my take is that asking whether a model can generalize is asking some what of a wrong question, we should be asking how close are two distributions in the space we care about (I.e. what’s the analogy and how deep is the analogy) and to do that we need to know the distribution it’s like asking

    - (2) Write essay on current life findings and goals as you approach 25
        - Life is tough. My goal has been to understand the brain and build an intelligent machine throughout the years. This still is my goal, but I’m realizing you need wealth, data, and economic systems to get there. Cracks at AGI have been hit by numerous companies like OpenAI, Google, and Meta, but I do think a need for these systems to be open access and distributed like the internet is important. I’ve decided to take a detour on the path for AGI through economics and distribution. I want to develop a fabric of AI open like the internet, globally maintained, trained, and held. Bitcoin did a great job of demonstrating how incentive systems can build trust and a decentralized network, I will take inspiration from this to build off of. At the same time while I develop this I need a career that is lucrative enough to provide funding for my ventures and support my family.
            - Thus my goal in order are: PhD (for clot), QR Trad->Crypto (as lucrative career), Fabric (as main project), BJJ/Sev (for health)

    - (9) Fabric White Paper
    - (10) Fabric MVP

    - (Later) Figure out Finances (monthly income and debt pay off plan)

October 11th, 2023

- GFlowNets
    - Like the video. I think Bengio is going a bit kookoo at times but I like all the promises of this architecture and how it relates to Model Based RL
    - Identifying DAGs with GFlowNets sounds sick af. Would be definetly interesting to see if it scales to robotic data, not just simulation data
        - it seems like they only need like 100 datapoints to get a graph with 20 - 50 edges
        - I like how GFlowNets were built with high cost oracles in mine
    - We should def find some time to meet this week I’m on KL Malaysian time
- History of Finance Video:
    - We need to get more and more out of the less and less we have, and finance does it
    - Computers will upend finance where information and market coordination becomes unfathomable
    - Affliction and Trust is everything
    - Markets make the allocation of resources more efficient and provides proper incentives
    - Quantification precision and prediction
        - more and more efficiency gains
    - Designing better systems is the goal
- Email to schonfeld
    - Project Generative Order Limit Book Modeling
        - Why I can do it:
            - Very interesting
            - Have knowledge with GANs through some research in undergrad and familiarity with LSTMs through courses
            - State-Space Models are used in Model Based RL all the time so is HiPPO
        -  What can be improved:
            - Only 102 Days of training data and 12 Days of validation and test data
            - Only with Google (small-tick) and Intel stock (large-tick)
            - Only do 10 levels of Order Book Data (prediction for 10 best prices)
            - It Truncates extreme orders <0.1% of data
            - Extrapolating only 100 time steps out given 500 orders
            - Over predicts Execution orders (maybe because of error correction mechanism)
        - Questions:
            - Predictive Power vs Inference Time
            - Out-of-Distribution (time) Perplexity 
            - Training Time vs Performance
                - How often would we need to retrain

- 
- After finishing What Color Is Your Parachute
    - A job like Quantitative Researcher at place like Nova Prospect would be nice
        - Or Quantbot on a Crypto related project
        - Or Citadel HQ on a new Crypto Division
    - But current career path is Quant for Crypto
    - And Start a Decentralized AI Company 
- So currently I’m lacking skills and funding to do it on my own. So I need to learn strategy development and full pipeline development for QR labs
- [[Life]]
- Goals:
    - MIT PhD (So they pay me well)

        - No need to normalize 
        - returns = (diff return) / returns
        - Remove normalized returns
        - sqrt(252) not just len(returns)
        - might want to fill
        - don't need to resample by the day
        - purfication as when you calculate sharpes to 252
        - cheating look ahead bias
        - Part 2:
            - fixed return computation should be a percentage
            - shift signal by 1, you have a look ahead bias
            - still have len in sharpes
            - strev should be (/ not -) for combined high and combined low
            - turn convex optimization to a loop with continous rebalancing everyday
        - Phrasing Quant Internship is important

- It's not uncommon for individuals to pursue careers that are somewhat different from their PhD research topics. While your PhD is in robotics and AI, it doesn't mean you can't transition into a career in Quantitative Research. The skills you've gained during your PhD, such as data analysis, programming, problem-solving, and critical thinking, can be highly transferable to quantitative roles.
- You can bridge the gap by gaining additional knowledge in finance, economics, and quantitative methods. Consider taking relevant courses, attending workshops or seminars, and networking with professionals in the field. Highlight the analytical and technical skills you've acquired during your PhD in your job applications and interviews, as these skills are highly valued in Quantitative Research positions.
- Remember, many employers appreciate diverse backgrounds and perspectives, so your robotics and AI background can be an asset, bringing a unique perspective to the field of quantitative research. It's about showcasing how your skills and experiences can contribute to the role, even if they aren't directly related.

- Start guiding research to be more quantitative

    - The intuitive sense of an assets value like when estimating the value of the place of Versailles can be broken into qualitative and quantitative measurements
        - for example we can use the income flow of the palace as a qualitative measurement or even the predicted income flow, but all of those will pave in comparison to its actual value
            - in these cases we should use qualitative measures like how much a person would buy it for or how many people would die for it, or the feeling of awe you get when seeing it
            - We can boil this intuition to a measuring how uncertain you are about the future income, and not measure able aleatoric uncertainty but epistemically uncertainty
            -  A model which uses a guess of epistemically uncertainty to trade off between quantitative and qualitative of measurements

- Research hard other peoples profiles who’ve got into JaneStreet, Citadel, AQR, etc. See what you can do and how
- Of course, I'd be happy to help! Let's break it down into steps:
- 1. **Reflect on Your Vacation:**
    - Take some time to think about what you enjoyed and what you'd like to change in your daily life based on your vacation experiences.
- 2. **Prioritize Tasks:**
    - Make a list of tasks you need to complete after returning, and prioritize them based on urgency and importance.
- 3. **Set Clear Goals:**
    - Define short-term and long-term goals for personal, professional, and health-related aspects of your life.
- 4. **Organize Your Space:**
    - Declutter and organize your living space to create a more productive and relaxing environment.
- 5. **Establish a Routine:**
    - Create a daily routine that includes time for work, exercise, relaxation, and personal activities.

- Remember, it's essential to be flexible and kind to yourself as you implement these changes. Let's start with the first step: reflecting on your vacation. What were some standout moments or insights from your vacation that you'd like to incorporate into your daily life?
- It's great that you've taken the time to reflect and outline your goals and plans. Let's break down your responses and start organizing the next steps:
- 1. Spending Time with Girlfriend:
    - Plan regular quality time with your girlfriend when you get back.
- 2. Exercise and BJJ:
    - Schedule regular BJJ sessions and establish a workout routine.
    - Aim to lose 10 pounds through consistent exercise and healthy eating.

If you're ready, you can start by prioritizing the items that are most important to you and scheduling them into your calendar. Let me know which step you'd like to tackle first, or if you need help breaking down any of the goals further!
- Absolutely, here's a breakdown of actionable steps you can take when you get back from vacation:
- *Spending Time with Girlfriend:**
