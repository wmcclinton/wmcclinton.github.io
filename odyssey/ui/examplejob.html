<h1>Job 0 (An Example Job for Odyssey Network)</h1>
<br>
<p>Hello Developer,</p>
<br>
<p>For this job you must write some code in python to compute the url content code for Odyssey.</p>
<p>To compute the code first hash (SHA256) the url's contents (stringyfied html, i.e. the return of a curl request) and then sum up the hash in decimal (each char is a 0-15 decimal number, compute the total of the 40 chars).</p>
<p>Lastly, make the website as a commandline argument for the script and only use these libraries: os, hashlib, and sys</p>
<br>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Willie</p>
