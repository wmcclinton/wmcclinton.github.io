<br>
<br>
Hello my name is Willie McClinton and I participated in the computer science&nbsp;<a href="http://cra.org/cra-w/dreu/" target="_blank">DREU program</a> during the summer of 2019. I did my research at the <a href="http://irl.cs.brown.edu/" target="_blank">Brown University's Intelligent Robot Lab</a>&nbsp;with Dr. George Konidaris, and plans to graduate from <a href="https://www.usf.edu/" target="_blank">University of South Florida</a> in May 2020. After, I will be pursuing post-graduate studies in the intersection between Cognitive Science, Robotics, and Artificial Intelligence.<br>
<br>
<h3>Project Description</h3>

My project for this summer will be in a subfield of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, called Reinforcement Learning (RL), where 
agents learn how to interact with their enviornment, in order to maximize some reward. The main problem we are trying to solve in RL is how to 
learn how to learn using a hierarchical structure, specifically how transfer between two related problems can be achieved by learning and 
reusing components of subproblems in each individual task.

The goal of this project is to understand transfer in the context of hierarchical reinforcement learning and publish our findings.

<h3>Weekly Logs</h3>
<h4>Week 1 [5/13/2019]</h5>

When I first got to Brown, I started setting up the computers with the enviornments I would need to run my experiments.
After I created a Brown CS account and got access to their computer grid, I started running baseline tests.
This included setting up an running the code from past projects with slight variations, in order to test our hypothesis about the flaws (lack of robustness) in the current state-of-the art learning algorithms.
<br>
<h4>Week 2 [5/20/2019]</h5>

The next week consited of running more baseline tests, in order to further verify the lack of robustness in other approaches and ways of improving them. Most of this week was spent reading papers in and around my topic. I spent some of this time exploring the University and Rhode Island School of Design.
<br>
<h4>Week 3 [5/27/2019]</h4>

The following week I brainstormed project ideas and created mini-abstracts including pros and cons, for 3 (under-explored) project directions that seemed promising to explore during the summer.
Then we chose the most interesting and do-able project given the time.
<br>
<h4>Week 4 [6/3/2019]</h5>

Out - Attending Sister's Gradution.
<br>
<h4>Week 5 [6/10/2019] </h5>

Out - Attending Internation Conference of Machine Learning.
<br>
<h4>Week 6 [6/17/2019]</h5>

When I returned from my long trip around the country, I fomulated my problem description and assumptions. I basically created a Latex doccument explaining the mathematics behind my algorithm and how it would work. Then I discussed the document with my prfoessor.
<br>
<h4>Week 7 [6/24/2019]</h5>

This week was spent with half my time either sleeping or eating at the neighboting sushi joint and half my time hammering out the approved alogrithm mentioned last week. I worked with one of my lab-mates past code and some code from other researchers open sourced on github. It took me a bit to understand their codes, but when I did altering it to suit my needs was staright forward.
<br>
<h4>Week 8 [7/1/2019]</h5>

This was a major debugging week. With the coding starting to take form, the dreaded silent bugs started to pop up when running longer experiments. I spent most of my time in the lab taking the newest bug, waiting for the epiphany when I finally see through the matrix. Alot of the time this week also went to preparing for my Marshal Scholarship Application and narrowing down grad school choices.
<br>
<h4>Week 9 [7/8/2019]</h5>

Now enter major debugging week part 2. This week was very similar to last week expect a lot of my writing for the upcoming fellowships and scholarships was used as a way to procrastinate instead of a healthy balancing sidetask.
<br>
<h4>Week 10 [7/15/2019]</h5>

This is the last week for DREU, and therefore the last week for my reading logs. I am currently getting some very preliminary results demonstrating transfer in our archetecture, while also failing incredibly hard to get the task inferencing at top level working (the Meta-Learning part). At this moment I'm also preparing to present at Brown's undergraduate research symposium and the Leadership Alliance National Symposium, which means I have to understand my research well enough to describe it to people who might not be familiar with it. Although, the DREU and Leadership Alliance Program are coming to a close I'll be staying here for a few more weeks to get some major work done, which I'm happy about because I love the environment.
