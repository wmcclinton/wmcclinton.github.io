<br>
Hello my name is Willie McClinton and I participated in the computer science&nbsp;<a href="http://cra.org/cra-w/dreu/" target="_blank">DREU program</a> during the summer of 2019. I did my research at the <a href="http://irl.cs.brown.edu/" target="_blank">Brown University's Intelligent Robot Lab</a>&nbsp;with Dr. George Konidaris, and plans to graduate from <a href="https://www.usf.edu/" target="_blank">University of South Florida</a> in May 2020. After, I will be pursuing post-graduate studies in the intersection between Cognitive Science, Robotics, and Artificial Intelligence.<br>
<br>
<h3>Project Description</h3>

My project for this summer will be in a subfield of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, called Reinforcement Learning (RL), where 
agents learn how to interact with their enviornment, in order to maximize some reward. The main problem we are trying to solve in RL is how to 
learn how to learn using a hierarchical structure, specifically how transfer between two related problems can be achieved by learning and 
reusing components of subproblems in each individual task.

The goal of this project is to understand transfer in the context of hierarchical reinforcement learning and publish our findings.

<h3>Weekly Logs</h3>
<h4>Week 1 [5/13/2019]</h5>

When I first got to Brown, I started setting up the computers with the enviornments I would need to run my experiments.
After I created a Brown CS account and got access to their computer grid, I started running baseline tests.
This included setting up an running the code from past projects with slight variations, in order to test our hypothesis about the flaws (lack of robustness) in the current state-of-the art learning algorithms.
<br>
<h4>Week 2 [5/20/2019]</h5>

The next week consited of running more baseline tests, in order to further verify the lack of robustness in other approaches and ways of improving them. Most of this week was spent reading papers in and around my topic. I spent some of this time exploring the University and Rhode Island School of Design.
<br>
<h4>Week 3 [5/27/2019]</h4>

The following week I brainstormed project ideas and created mini-abstracts including pros and cons, for 3 (under-explored) project directions that seemed promising to explore during the summer.
Then we chose the most interesting and do-able project given the time.
<br>
<h4>Week 4 [6/3/2019]</h5>

Out - Attending Sister's Gradution.
<br>
<h4>Week 5 [6/10/2019] </h5>

Out - Attending Internation Conference of Machine Learning.
<br>
<h4>Week 6 [6/17/2019]</h5>

When I returned from my long trip around the country, I fomulated my problem description and assumptions. I basically created a Latex doccument explaining the mathematics behind my algorithm and how it would work. Then I discussed the document with my prfoessor.
